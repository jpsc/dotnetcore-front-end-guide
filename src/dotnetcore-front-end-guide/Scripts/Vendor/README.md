# Custom jquery build

Created with [jQuery custom build](https://github.com/jquery/jquery#how-to-build-your-own-jquery),
with the following parameters:

-ajax/jsonp,
-ajax/script,
-css,
-effects,
-dimensions,
-offset,
-deprecated,
-event/alias,
-event/focusin,
-wrap,
-core/ready

For more information [check here](https://github.com/jquery/jquery#modules).

We choose to do this to keep the file size smaller and also
to prevent the developer from using unecessary methods like `.css()`.
